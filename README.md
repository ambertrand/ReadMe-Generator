## Description

### Project Link:

## Technologies Used

## Developer Notes:
For this project I was tasked with developing a quality README through using the CLI to prompt questions to the user.  Once the user answered the questions the README would be created.

For this project working with Node.js was completely new so I had to start with going through some of the class excercies from the previous week as well as re-listening to parts of classes to get the info I needed to start.  What really helped me was the last project from the Saturday class and I was able to take use alot of the info from that project in this one.
